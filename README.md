# Compose Rich Text

**Project status:** Proof of concept

Compose Rich Text aims to make rendering rich text easier
with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

The library has been designed with modularity in mind, decoupling the source rich text format and the target visual
output.

## Features

### Currently supported

#### Source formats

- Markdown ([CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) spec)
  - Except embedded HTML
  - Except images

#### Target outputs

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
  - Configurable styling of both blocks and inline text, using Foundation APIs
  - Not dependent on any specific design system like Material

### Future plans

- Proper documentation, both in code and published online
- Release artifact(s)
- DSL for writing rich text in Kotlin
- Support some HTML tags as input
- Support some HTML tags embedded in Markdown
- Support links within documents
- Support Markdown tables
- Target [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/), if possible
